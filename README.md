## 🔬 Introduction  
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. **Early detection is crucial** in improving survival rates. This project leverages **machine learning** to analyze medical data and predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant**.  

---  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Multiple Machine Learning Models** – SVM, Random Forest, KNN, etc.  
✅ **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Insights**  
✅ **Performance Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall & F1-score**  

---  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset used is the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)** from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains **30 features** extracted from digitized images of fine-needle aspirates of breast masses.
